# leaflet-challenge
In this repository, the index.html was provided in the starter code, and the Leaflet-Part-2 
is empty. Leaflet-Part-1 is where the assignment is. The style.css and logic.js files in the 
Leaflet-Part-1 files are linked to the HTML to render the Earthquake map.

This assignment was tricky! The legend portion was tough. I reappropriated a ton of code from 
the class exercises, and was provided the for loop for the legend by TAs who were helping me 
troubleshoot. I consulted AskBCS and the TAs multiple time. The code is a piecewise framework 
which borrowed from the exercises. But it works, and I understand how to interpret it. That is 
the important part.

Please let me know if there are any issues, as I want to maintain my streak of good assignment 
grades. Thank you for grading. Cheers.
